## Section 1: The Origin of N'Ko

### The Story of Solomana Kanté

The N'Ko alphabet was invented by **Solomana Kanté** in 1949 in Bingerville, Côte d'Ivoire. The name "N'Ko" means **"I say"** in all Manding languages, representing the voice and identity of West African peoples.

**ߒߞߏ** - N'Ko (pronounced "en-kaw")

Solomana Kanté created the script after reading an article that claimed African languages were "primitive" and couldn't be written. Determined to prove this wrong, he developed N'Ko as a writing system specifically designed for Manding languages.

### Cultural Significance

N'Ko represents more than just a writing system—it's a symbol of:
- **African intellectual achievement**
- **Cultural preservation**
- **Linguistic independence**
