# Tone Marks and Diacritics

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of tones in Manding languages
- Recognize all N'Ko tone marks and diacritics
- Apply tone marks correctly to change word meanings
- Read N'Ko text with proper tonal pronunciation
- Use lengthening marks and other special symbols

## Section 1: Introduction to Tones

### What Are Tones?

Manding languages are **tonal languages**, meaning that the pitch or tone of your voice can change the meaning of a word. N'Ko uses special marks called **diacritics** to indicate these tones.

**Example of Tone Importance:**
- ߓߊ (ba) with low tone = "mother"
- ߓߊ߫ (ba) with high tone = "big"
- ߓߊ߬ (ba) with falling tone = "river"

### The Three Basic Tones

N'Ko represents three primary tones:
1. **High Tone** - Voice pitch goes up ↗
2. **Low Tone** - Voice pitch goes down ↘  
3. **Falling Tone** - Voice pitch falls from high to low ↘↘

### Exercise 1: Tone Concept

**Question:** What can change the meaning of a word in tonal languages?
- A) Volume (loudness)
- B) Pitch/tone ✓
- C) Speed of speaking
- D) Breathing pattern

**Explanation:** In tonal languages like those written in N'Ko, the pitch or tone of your voice determines word meaning.

## Section 2: The Primary Tone Marks

### High Tone Mark: ߫

**Symbol:** ߫ (Unicode U+07EB)
**Name:** N'Ko High Tone Apostrophe
**Usage:** Placed after a vowel to indicate high tone
**Sound:** Voice pitch rises

**Examples:**
- ߓߊ߫ (bá) - big/large
- ߞߊ߫ (ká) - to do (emphatic)
- ߛߊ߫ (sá) - to be able
- ߟߊ߫ (lá) - to put

**Practice Words:**
- ߝߘߊ߫ (fadá) - father (formal)
- ߡߊߟߊ߫ (malá) - king (respectful)

### Low/Falling Tone Mark: ߬

**Symbol:** ߬ (Unicode U+07EC)
**Name:** N'Ko Low Tone Apostrophe  
**Usage:** Placed after a vowel to indicate low or falling tone
**Sound:** Voice pitch falls

**Examples:**
- ߓߊ߬ (bà) - river
- ߞߊ߬ (kà) - to refuse
- ߛߊ߬ (sà) - to die (variant)
- ߟߊ߬ (là) - to go (past tense)

**Practice Words:**
- ߞߊ߬ߙߊ߲ (kàran) - to learn
- ߝߘߊ߬ (fadà) - father's

### Exercise 2: Basic Tone Marks

**Question:** Which tone mark indicates high tone?
- A) ߬
- B) ߫ ✓  
- C) ߭
- D) None

**Explanation:** The mark ߫ indicates high tone, making the voice pitch rise when pronouncing the vowel.

## Section 3: Vowel Length and Nasalization

### Vowel Length Mark: ߺ

**Symbol:** ߺ (Unicode U+07FA)
**Name:** N'Ko Lajanyalan (Lengthening Mark)
**Usage:** Indicates a long vowel sound
**Sound:** The vowel is held longer

**Examples:**
- ߓߊߺ (baa) - really/very (intensifier)
- ߞߊߺ (kaa) - to do repeatedly
- ߛߊߺ (saa) - time/hour (extended)

**Long vs. Short Comparison:**
- ߓߊ (ba) - mother (short)
- ߓߊߺ (baa) - river/big river (long)

### Sukun Mark: ߭

**Symbol:** ߭ (Unicode U+07ED)
**Name:** N'Ko Sukun
**Usage:** Indicates absence of a vowel sound
**Sound:** No vowel sound is pronounced

**Examples:**
- ߞߊ߲߭ (kan°) - word/speech
- ߛߊ߲߭ (san°) - year
- ߝߊ߲߭ (fan°) - place where

### Exercise 3: Length and Sukun

**Question:** What does the mark ߺ indicate?
- A) High tone
- B) Low tone
- C) Long vowel ✓
- D) No vowel

**Explanation:** The mark ߺ (lajanyalan) indicates that the vowel should be pronounced longer than normal.

## Section 4: Special Diacritical Marks

### Dantayalan Mark: ߮

**Symbol:** ߮ (Unicode U+07EE)
**Name:** N'Ko Dantayalan
**Usage:** Indicates syllable boundary or emphasis
**Sound:** Brief pause or syllable separation

**Examples:**
- ߞߊ߮ߙߊ߲ (ka•ran) - learning (with syllable break)
- ߛߊ߮ߟߊ (sa•la) - prayer (with emphasis)

### Dorome Mark: ߯

**Symbol:** ߯ (Unicode U+07EF) 
**Name:** N'Ko Dorome
**Usage:** Indicates strong emphasis or exclamation
**Sound:** Emphatic pronunciation

**Examples:**
- ߞߊ߯ (ka!) - do it! (emphatic command)
- ߛߊ߯ (sa!) - come! (urgent call)

### Gbakurunen Mark: ߰

**Symbol:** ߰ (Unicode U+07F0)
**Name:** N'Ko Gbakurunen
**Usage:** Indicates questioning intonation
**Sound:** Rising questioning tone

**Examples:**
- ߞߊ߰ (ka?) - to do? (question)
- ߡߍ߰ (mɛ?) - what? (question particle)

### Exercise 4: Special Marks

**Question:** Which mark indicates a questioning intonation?
- A) ߮
- B) ߯
- C) ߰ ✓
- D) ߭

**Explanation:** The mark ߰ (gbakurunen) indicates questioning intonation or uncertainty.

## Section 5: Combining Marks in Practice

### Multiple Diacritics

N'Ko words can have multiple diacritical marks to convey complex meanings:

**Complex Examples:**
- ߞߊ߬ߙߊ߲߫ (kàrán) - "learning" with falling tone on first syllable, high tone on second
- ߛߊ߬ߟߊ߫ (sàlá) - "prayer" with falling then high tones
- ߝߘߊ߬ߦߊ߫ (fadàyá) - "father's child" with complex toning

### Reading Strategy

When encountering diacritics:
1. **Read the base letters first** - Get the consonants and vowels
2. **Apply tone marks** - Adjust pitch according to marks
3. **Apply other marks** - Length, emphasis, etc.
4. **Practice slowly** - Build muscle memory for tonal patterns

### Common Tonal Patterns

**High-Low Pattern:**
- ߞߊ߫ߙߊ߬ (kárà) - to read (high-low)
- ߛߊ߫ߟߊ߬ (sálà) - to pray (high-low)

**Low-High Pattern:**
- ߞߊ߬ߙߊ߫ (kàrá) - lesson (low-high)
- ߛߊ߬ߟߊ߫ (sàlá) - prayer (low-high)

### Exercise 5: Complex Reading

**Question:** In the word ߞߊ߬ߙߊ߲߫, what tonal pattern is used?
- A) High-high
- B) Low-high ✓
- C) High-low  
- D) Low-low

**Explanation:** The word shows ߞߊ߬ (low tone) followed by ߙߊ߲߫ (high tone), creating a low-high pattern.

## Section 6: Practical Applications

### Minimal Pairs with Tones

Understanding tones helps distinguish between words that look similar:

| Word | Tones | Meaning | Usage |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
| ߓߊ | neutral | mother | ߒ ߓߊ (my mother) |
| ߓߊ߫ | high | big | ߓߊ߫ ߛߏ (big horse) |
| ߓߊ߬ | low/falling | river | ߓߊ߬ ߘߊ (river mouth) |

| Word | Tones | Meaning | Usage |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
| ߞߊ | neutral | to do | ߞߊ ߞߍ (to do something) |
| ߞߊ߫ | high | ká | to do! | fais! |
| ߞߊ߬ | low/falling | to refuse | ߞߊ߬ ߞߍ (to refuse to do) |

### Context and Meaning

Tones help clarify meaning in context:

**Without tones (ambiguous):**
ߒ ߓ ߞߊ ߟߏ ߘߊ
"I want to do something today"

**With tones (clear):**
ߒ ߓߍ߫ ߞߊ߫ ߟߏ߫ ߘߊ߫
"I want to do work today" (specific meaning)

### Exercise 6: Contextual Understanding

**Question:** Why are tone marks important in N'Ko?
- A) They make words look prettier
- B) They distinguish word meanings ✓
- C) They are optional decorations
- D) They indicate volume

**Explanation:** Tone marks are essential because they distinguish between words that would otherwise look identical but have different meanings.

## Cultural Context

### Tones in Oral Tradition

Tones carry cultural significance:

**In Traditional Music:**
- **Drum language** - Drums mimic tonal patterns
- **Call and response** - Tonal patterns in songs
- **Praise poetry** - Specific tonal formulas

**In Daily Speech:**
- **Respect levels** - Higher tones for respect
- **Emotional expression** - Tones convey feelings
- **Regional identity** - Dialectal tonal differences

### Literary Uses

N'Ko literature uses tones for:
- **Poetry rhythm** - Tonal patterns create meter
- **Emphasis** - Important words get special tones
- **Character voices** - Different tones for different speakers
- **Meaning layers** - Multiple interpretations through tones

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned:

1. **Tone Concept**: How pitch changes word meanings in Manding languages
2. **Primary Marks**: High tone (߫) and low/falling tone (߬)
3. **Length Marks**: Vowel lengthening (ߺ) and absence (߭)
4. **Special Marks**: Emphasis (߯), syllable breaks (߮), questions (߰)
5. **Practical Application**: Reading complex tonal patterns
6. **Cultural Context**: Tones in music, literature, and daily life

Mastering tone marks is crucial for proper N'Ko pronunciation and comprehension. These marks transform the script from a simple alphabet into a sophisticated system that captures the full richness of Manding languages.
