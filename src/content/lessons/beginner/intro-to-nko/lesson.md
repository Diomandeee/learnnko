## Section 1: The Origin of N'Ko

The N'Ko alphabet was invented by Solomana Kante in 1949 in Bingerville, Côte d'Ivoire. The name "N'Ko" means "I say" in all Manding languages.

Solomana Kante created the script after reading an article that claimed African languages were "primitive" and couldn't be written. Determined to prove this wrong, he developed N'Ko as a writing system specifically designed for Manding languages.

N'Ko is written from right to left, with 27 letters including 7 vowels and 20 consonants. It also includes diacritical marks for tones and other linguistic features.
