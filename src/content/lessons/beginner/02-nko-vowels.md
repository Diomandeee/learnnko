# N'Ko Vowels

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Recognize all seven N'Ko vowel characters
- Pronounce each vowel correctly
- Understand the difference between oral and nasal vowels
- Write basic N'Ko vowel combinations
- Use vowels as the foundation for word formation

## Section 1: Introduction to N'Ko Vowels

### The Seven Vowels

N'Ko has **seven vowel letters** that represent the fundamental sounds of Manding languages. These vowels are the building blocks of all N'Ko words.

**The Complete N'Ko Vowel Set:**

| N'Ko | Latin | Pronunciation | English Sound |
|------|-------|---------------|---------------|
| **ߊ** | a | [a] | "ah" as in "father" |
| **ߍ** | ɛ | [ɛ] | "eh" as in "bed" |
| **ߎ** | u | [u] | "oo" as in "moon" |
| **ߏ** | ɔ | [ɔ] | "aw" as in "law" |
| **ߐ** | ɛ̃ | [ɛ̃] | nasal "eh" |
| **ߑ** | ã | [ã] | nasal "ah" |
| **ߒ** | ɲ | [ɲ] | "ny" as in "canyon" |

### Oral vs. Nasal Vowels

N'Ko distinguishes between:
- **Oral vowels**: Air flows through the mouth (ߊ ߍ ߎ ߏ)
- **Nasal vowels**: Air flows through nose and mouth (ߐ ߑ)
- **Special consonant**: ߒ represents the "ny" sound

### Exercise 1: Vowel Recognition

**Question:** Which N'Ko character represents the "oo" sound as in "moon"?
- A) ߊ
- B) ߍ
- C) ߎ ✓
- D) ߏ

**Explanation:** ߎ (u) represents the [u] sound, like "oo" in "moon" or "boot".

## Section 2: The Four Oral Vowels

### ߊ - "A" Sound [a]

**Character:** ߊ
**Pronunciation:** Like "ah" in "father"
**Examples:**
- ߊ߫ (a) - he/she/it
- ߓߊ (ba) - mother
- ߞߊ (ka) - do/make

**Practice Words:**
- ߞߊߣߊ (kana) - to count
- ߓߊߟߊ (bala) - dance

### ߍ - "Ɛ" Sound [ɛ]

**Character:** ߍ
**Pronunciation:** Like "eh" in "bed"
**Examples:**
- ߍ߫ (ɛ) - you
- ߓߍ (bɛ) - sow/plant
- ߞߍ (kɛ) - thing/matter

**Practice Words:**
- ߕߍߡߊ (tɛma) - time
- ߝߍ (fɛ) - two

### ߎ - "U" Sound [u]

**Character:** ߎ
**Pronunciation:** Like "oo" in "moon"
**Examples:**
- ߎ߫ (u) - they
- ߓߎ (bu) - place
- ߞߎ (ku) - head

**Practice Words:**
- ߞߎߟߎ (kulu) - boat
- ߓߎߟߎ (bulu) - bread

### ߏ - "Ɔ" Sound [ɔ]

**Character:** ߏ
**Pronunciation:** Like "aw" in "law"
**Examples:**
- ߏ߫ (ɔ) - that/those
- ߓߏ (bɔ) - house
- ߞߏ (kɔ) - what

**Practice Words:**
- ߟߏ (lɔ) - day
- ߣߏ (nɔ) - here

### Exercise 2: Oral Vowel Practice

**Question:** What sound does ߍ make?
- A) "ah" as in "father"
- B) "eh" as in "bed" ✓
- C) "oo" as in "moon"
- D) "aw" as in "law"

**Explanation:** ߍ represents the [ɛ] sound, similar to the "e" in "bed" or "pet".

## Section 3: Nasal Vowels

### ߐ - Nasal "Ɛ̃" Sound [ɛ̃]

**Character:** ߐ
**Pronunciation:** Nasal "eh" sound
**Description:** Like "eh" but with air flowing through the nose
**Examples:**
- ߛߐ (sɔ̃) - horse
- ߞߐ (kɔ̃) - outside
- ߟߐ (lɔ̃) - learn

### ߑ - Nasal "Ã" Sound [ã]

**Character:** ߑ
**Pronunciation:** Nasal "ah" sound
**Description:** Like "ah" but with air flowing through the nose
**Examples:**
- ߛߑ (sã) - elephant
- ߞߑ (kã) - neck
- ߟߑ (lã) - meat

### Practicing Nasal Sounds

To practice nasal vowels:
1. Say the oral vowel normally
2. Pinch your nose closed
3. Try to make the same sound - you'll feel the air trying to escape through your nose
4. Release your nose and let the air flow through both mouth and nose

### Exercise 3: Nasal Vowels

**Question:** How do nasal vowels differ from oral vowels?
- A) They are louder
- B) Air flows through nose and mouth ✓
- C) They are written differently
- D) They are shorter

**Explanation:** Nasal vowels allow air to flow through both the nose and mouth, creating a distinct resonant sound quality.

## Section 4: The Special Character ߒ

### ߒ - "Ny" Sound [ɲ]

**Character:** ߒ
**Pronunciation:** Like "ny" in "canyon" or "gn" in French "agneau"
**Function:** Often used as both a vowel and consonant
**Examples:**
- ߒߞߏ (n'ko) - "I say" (the name of the script)
- ߒߘߊ (n'da) - path
- ߒߟߊ (n'la) - cow

### Special Uses of ߒ

1. **As a pronoun:** ߒ = "I"
2. **In the script name:** ߒߞߏ = N'Ko
3. **In possessive forms:** ߒ ߓߊ = "my mother"
4. **In verbal constructions:** Common in verb conjugations

### Exercise 4: The ߒ Character

**Question:** What does ߒߞߏ mean?
- A) "You say"
- B) "I say" ✓
- C) "We say"
- D) "They say"

**Explanation:** ߒߞߏ (N'Ko) means "I say" and is the name of the entire writing system.

## Section 5: Vowel Combinations and Patterns

### Common Vowel Sequences

N'Ko words often contain multiple vowels in sequence:

**Two-vowel combinations:**
- ߊߎ (au) - in words like ߞߊߎ (kau) - "to take"
- ߍߊ (ɛa) - in words like ߞߍߊ (kɛa) - "to do"
- ߏߊ (ɔa) - in words like ߟߏߊ (lɔa) - "today"

### Long and Short Vowels

Vowel length can change meaning:
- **Short:** ߓߊ (ba) - "mother"
- **Long:** ߓߊߊ (baa) - "river"

### Exercise 5: Vowel Combinations

**Question:** In the word ߞߊߎ (kau), how many vowels are present?
- A) 1
- B) 2 ✓
- C) 3
- D) 4

**Explanation:** The word ߞߊߎ contains two vowels: ߊ (a) and ߎ (u).

## Vocabulary

| N'Ko | Latin | English | French |
|------|-------|---------|---------|
| ߊ߫ | a | he/she/it | il/elle |
| ߍ߫ | ɛ | you | tu/vous |
| ߎ߫ | u | they | ils/elles |

1. ߊ ߊ ߊ ߊ ߊ
2. ߍ ߍ ߍ ߍ ߍ
3. ߎ ߎ ߎ ߎ ߎ
4. ߏ ߏ ߏ ߏ ߏ
5. ߐ ߐ ߐ ߐ ߐ

- B) ߍ
- C) ߐ ✓
- D) ߒ

**Explanation:** ߐ represents the nasal "eh" sound [ɛ̃], where air flows through both nose and mouth.

## Cultural Context

### Vowels in Manding Languages

The seven-vowel system of N'Ko reflects the phonological structure of Manding languages:
- **Bambara** (Mali)
- **Mandinka** (Gambia, Senegal)
- **Jula** (Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire)
- **Susu** (Guinea)

### Traditional Uses

Vowels carry important meaning in:
- **Personal names:** Many names are vowel-heavy
- **Greetings:** Essential vowel combinations
- **Religious expressions:** Sacred vowel patterns
- **Poetry and music:** Vowel harmonies in traditional arts

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned:

1. **Seven N'Ko Vowels**: ߊ ߍ ߎ ߏ ߐ ߑ ߒ
2. **Oral vs. Nasal**: Four oral vowels and two nasal vowels
3. **Pronunciation Guide**: Specific sounds for each vowel
4. **Special Character**: ߒ as both vowel and consonant
5. **Vowel Combinations**: How vowels work together in words
6. **Cultural Context**: Vowels in Manding language families

Mastering N'Ko vowels is essential because they form the foundation of every word. Practice recognizing and pronouncing these sounds, as they will appear in every N'Ko text you encounter.

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, you'll learn the **first set of N'Ko consonants**. With vowels mastered, you'll be able to start forming complete syllables and simple words!

*Practice these vowel sounds daily by reading them aloud and listening to their distinct pronunciations. The muscle memory for both sound and sight recognition will serve as your foundation for all future N'Ko learning.*
