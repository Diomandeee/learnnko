# N'Ko Consonants (Part 1)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Recognize the first 10 N'Ko consonant characters
- Pronounce each consonant correctly
- Combine consonants with vowels to form syllables
- Read simple N'Ko words using learned characters
- Understand consonant variations and sounds

## Section 1: Introduction to N'Ko Consonants

### The Complete Consonant System

N'Ko has **20 consonant letters** that represent the consonant sounds in Manding languages. In this lesson, we'll learn the first 10 consonants, which are among the most commonly used.

**First 10 Consonants:**

### How Consonants Work

Unlike vowels which can stand alone, consonants typically combine with vowels to form syllables:
- **Consonant + Vowel = Syllable**
- Example: ߓ (b) + ߊ (a) = ߓߊ (ba) = "mother"

### Exercise 1: Consonant Recognition

- A) 10
