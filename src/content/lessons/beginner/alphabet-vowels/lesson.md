# N'Ko Vowels

## About This Lesson

In this lesson, you'll learn the seven vowels of the N'Ko alphabet, their shapes, and how to pronounce them correctly.

## Learning Objectives

- Recognize all seven N'Ko vowel characters
- Correctly pronounce each vowel sound
- Understand the relationship between N'Ko vowels and IPA symbols
- Write basic vowel characters

## Section 1: Introduction to N'Ko Vowels

The N'Ko alphabet has seven vowels, representing the seven basic vowel sounds found in Manding languages.

Unlike many other writing systems, N'Ko has a unique character for each vowel sound, making it very precise for representing pronunciation.

In this lesson, we'll learn each vowel, its pronunciation, and how to write it.

## Section 2: The Seven Vowels

Here are the seven vowels of the N'Ko alphabet. Listen to the pronunciation of each and practice saying them aloud.

Pay careful attention to the mouth position for each vowel sound.

| N'Ko | IPA | Example Word | Mouth Position |
|------|-----|--------------|----------------|
| ߊ | a | "father" | Open, relaxed |
| ߋ | e | "day" | Mid-high, spread |
| ߌ | i | "machine" | High, spread |
| ߍ | ɛ | "bet" | Mid-low, spread |
| ߎ | u | "food" | High, rounded |
| ߏ | o | "hope" | Mid-high, rounded |
| ߐ | ɔ | "thought" | Mid-low, rounded |

The third vowel is ߌ, which represents the "i" sound as in "machine" or "see".

It looks like a vertical line with a dot on the right side.

To write it:
1. Start at the top
2. Draw a vertical line downward
3. Add a dot to the right of the middle of the line

### Exercise: Vowel Recognition

**Question:** Which sound does this vowel (ߌ) represent?
- [ ] "a" as in "father"
- [ ] "e" as in "day"

## Section 4: Vowel Comparison

Let's compare all the vowels together. Notice the similarities and differences in their shapes.

The N'Ko vowels are designed with consistent elements that make them easy to distinguish:

- All have a vertical stroke
- They differ in the attachments to the basic vertical stroke
- The design is systematic, making them easier to learn and remember

### Exercise: Vowel Matching

**Question:** Match each N'Ko vowel with its sound:
- ߊ = a as in father
- ߋ = e as in day
- ߌ = i as in machine
- ߍ = ɛ as in bet
- ߎ = u as in food
- ߏ = o as in hope
- ߐ = ɔ as in thought

## Section 5: Practice Recognition

Now let's practice recognizing all seven vowels.

Take your time and get comfortable identifying each one.

### Exercise: Vowel Identification

**Question:** Which vowel is this? ߋ
- [ ] a
- [x] e
- [ ] i
- [ ] ɛ

- [ ] u
- [ ] o

- [x] i
- [ ] ɛ
- [ ] o

**Question:** The vowel ߎ represents the sound 'u' as in _____.

## Summary

In this lesson, you've learned all seven vowels of the N'Ko alphabet:

- ߊ (a) as in "father"
- ߋ (e) as in "day"
- ߌ (i) as in "machine"
- ߍ (ɛ) as in "bet"
- ߎ (u) as in "food"
- ߏ (o) as in "hope"
- ߐ (ɔ) as in "thought"

You can now recognize these vowels, understand their sounds, and know the basics of how to write them.

In the next lesson, you'll learn the first group of consonants in the N'Ko alphabet and start combining them with vowels to form syllables.
